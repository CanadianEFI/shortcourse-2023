COVID-19 Ontario forecasting project: Should we mask or not? 

Background: 

It is March 31st 2020, with covid wreaking havoc, Ontario policy makers are looking for solutions that can reduce spread and avoid collapsing the healthcare system. This study is designed to inform policy makers on the estimated burden of COVID-19 cases through April and the potential impact of methods used to reduce the transmission of the virus between people. We estimated how many cases of COVID-19 will occur in April 2020 in Ontario, using data available up until the end of March 2020. We then examined how this may change under different policy scenarios.  The policy scenarios tested included i) no action, ii) lockdown of non-essential services and iii) lockdown plus mask mandates.​

Methods:

We built a mathematical model to forecast COVID-19 infections in Ontario.  We used a compartmental model, a type of model used for infectious diseases that separates the population into those who are susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed (no longer infected or susceptible) at each timepoint. We provided key parameters to the model which are then revised by the model over iterations. The key parameters used in this model include an estimate of the transition from each compartment to the next; initially using the best available estimates for rate of infection, incubation period (time from infection to symptoms), and the infectiousness period. We used methods to account for uncertainty in the parameters.  ​

Results: 

We found that the number of people needing hospital care went down from XX without introducing any measures to XX with mask mandates and XX with lockdown. Following the number of predicted hospitalizations, we found if policy makers do not introduce any protective measures, there will very likely be no hospital beds available for anyone needing it by June 30 2020.​

Conclusions: 

These findings provide government decision-markers with the estimated burden of COVID-19 in the Ontario population during the month of April 2020. We also estimated the burden of COVID-19 with and without a mask mandate, given information available at the time of estimation. This information can be used to inform healthcare capacity planning and implementation of emergency measures required to accommodate the increase in disease.
