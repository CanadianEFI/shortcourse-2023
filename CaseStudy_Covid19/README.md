# Covid-19 Case Studies

There are two versions of the case study that deals with Covid-19. The first one, housed in `covid-bc` is a case study and associated materials for the outbreak modeling specific to British Columbia. The second, `covid-on` is related to data and models developed by McMaster University for the outbreak in Ontario. 

Both are related in that they rely on versions of the classic S(E)IR model, but use different techniques and software to model the outbreak. Feel free to poke around both and go through the example you find most interesting. 

Please do note that the software we use is system-specific and you will need to either work with the material directly on your machine, or engage with the container provided for you through Docker or `renv`.
