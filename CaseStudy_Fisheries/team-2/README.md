## Lay Summary

Salmon fisheries provide jobs and food, while the fish themselves perform crucial roles in their ecosystems and are important to the cultural heritage of certain communities. To ensure that there will be enough salmon to harvest, we have to plan for the amount of salmon that can be caught for the next year without reducing the population size so much. Otherwise, it will not be able to sustain itself in future years.  

In recent years, we see that predictions of the population size performed less well, therefore we increase uncertainty in the amount of fish that can be harvested. To ensure more accurate predictions in the future,  we evaluated other methods that can be used to predict population size to see if we could improve our predictions of the Early Stuart Fraser Sockeye Salmon population in British Columbia, Canada. 

We found that using the power model indeed improved these estimates. Next, we used this new model to estimate the 2023 population size. We predict that the salmon population will likely decrease further and that its size will reach dangerously low levels. We recommend reducing the amount of harvestable fish in 2023 to ensure that the population can grow back to a healthy size and to increase the amount of harvestable fish in future years.
