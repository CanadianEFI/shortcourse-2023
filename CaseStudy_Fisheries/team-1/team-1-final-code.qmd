## 1. Basic Ricker Model

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The Ricker model is a discrete stock-recruitment model that incorporates population growth ($\alpha$) and carrying capacity ($\beta$) for Pacific Salmon. Of all the available stocks, Early Stewart population was randomly chosen since it is one of many that is sensitive to environmental changes (see below models).

It assumes the chosen population experiences density dependence.
:::

Consider the following model:

$$
R_i = \alpha S_i e^{-\beta S_i} 
$$ {#eq-1}

population growth ($\alpha$) and carrying capacity ($\beta$)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can linearize to obtain simpler parameters:

$$
ln(R_i) = ln(\alpha)+ ln(S_i)-S_i/S_{max}
$$ {#eq-2}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We place priors on the following:

$$
ln(\alpha) \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha}, \tau{\alpha}) 
$$ {#eq-4}

$$
ln(S\_{max}) \sim normal(\mu_{Smax}, \tau_{Smax})
$$ {#eq-5}

$$
\tau \sim gamma(\theta, \theta)
$$ {#eq-6}

## 2. Alternate Models {.scrollable}

Power Model

Power Model with environmental covariate

## Alternate 1: Power model {.scrollable}

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
This alternate model is basically shows that log(recruiters) depends on log(spawners). This is also known as a simple power model which does not assume density dependence.
:::

based on the assumption that log(recruiters) depends on log(spawners)

$$
R_i = e^A S_i^B
$$ {#eq-10}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can linearize equation 10 to the following: $$
ln(R_i) = A+B*ln(S_i)
$$ {#eq-11}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This model form has normal priors for both $A$ and $B$:

$$
A \sim normal(\mu_{A}, \tau_{A}) 
$$ {#eq-12} $$
B \sim normal(\mu_{B}, \tau_{B})
$$ {#eq-13}

And the same gamma prior on precision as the above models (equation 6).

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Note: Jake Lawlor wrote an exploratory R script where he found a significant 1:1 relationship using the lm() function. The explanatory power is 69% (R2). Seems like a promising start for trying to forecast the Early Stewart population!
:::

## Alternate 2: Power model with temperature covariate

This alternate model is an extension to the previous power model that includes the average sea surface temperatures as an environmental covariate:

$$
R_i = e^{A+gEsst_{i}} S_i
$$ {#eq-14}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can linearize this as the following: $$
ln(R_i) = A+B*ln(S_i)+gEsst_{i}
$$ {#eq-15}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used the same priors for $A$, $B$, as previous above models and a normal (flat) prior for $g$:

$$
g \sim normal(\mu_g, \tau_g )
$$ {#eq-9}

## 3. Model Comparisons

## Create retroactive predictions

We used our models to predict recruits in years 2011-2021, then check against real data to assess model performance.

## 

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/model_fits_plot.png")
```

## Performance Metrics

Metric 1: Offset from true prediction

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/predicted_real_offset_plot.png")
```

## Performance Metrics

Metrics 2, 3, & 4:

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/model_performances.png")
```

## 4. Model Suggestion

In all performance metrics, our **Power & Temperature Model** performed best.

## 5. Practice Forecasts

We proceeded to apply our three forecast models to predict 2022 recruits.

# put graph of models being compared here

# put graph of models being compared here

```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
All models slightly under-predicted recruits, but each contained the true value within uncertainty shadow.

i.e., forecasts are *okay*.

## 6. Forecast 2023

Seeing that our forecasts were reasonable so far, we used our models to predict recruits in 2023.

## 6. Forecast the future

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/pred_plot_2023.png")

```

## 6. Forecast the future

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/pred_plot_2023.png")
```

PANIC! - why are predicted values so low??

## 6.2 Investigate unexpected predictions

We investigated model parameters to identify reasons our predictions were so low. The temperature covariate model is lowest, but all 3 values are low, indicating a probable *anomaly in the S (spawners) variable*.

## 6.2 Investigate unexpected predictions
```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/Spawners_plot_2023.png")
```
2019 spawners dip will likely affect 2023 Returns. Could this spawner count really be so low??


## 6.2 Investigate unexpected predictions
yes. 
```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
# put graph of models being compared here
knitr::include_graphics("plots/background info/landslide_screenshot.png")
```

Considering this, our projected low values of 2023 recruits are reasonable (read: not an error on our part).

## Assessment of Stock

Compared to global historical mean

-   **Yellow** = prediction within +/-0.5sd of global historical mean

-   **Green** = prediction larger than global historical mean by more than +0.5sd

-   **Red** = prediction smaller than global historical mean by more than -0.5sd
