## Learning Exercises

These are designed to help you get familiar with both the specific software we use in this course, as well as the concept of doing forecasting more generally. 

You do not necessarily need to do them all. 

### Activity 0 - GitHub

GitHub is a website that uses Git (a software) to do version control, which allows us to work collaboratively on projects in the cloud. This might be new to some folks, and so the first activity we have for you is to go through this GitHub introduction and become familiar with how it works. It will be essential for this course. 

### Activity 1 - Bayesian Modeling

There are two activities here that are "primers" to using a Bayesian modeling software. The goal of these exercises is to walk you through the how-to of building and fitting a model in one of the two softwares used in this course 

#### Activity 1 - JAGS 

The first is in JAGS, which is a slightly older, but well-used software for Bayesian models. 

Note that you will need to have JAGS downloaded onto your computer before you can go through this primer. You can download it for your operating system [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/). 

#### Activity 1 - STAN

Stan is a sightly newer software that has some advantages, but is slightly more complex to get running on your own machine. In order to try and streamline this process, we use a docker container (a software that sets up a virtual environment) to try and make this simpler across operating systems. See the README in that folder for more info. 

### Activity 2 - Pair Coding

Pair coding, or literally coding in pairs, is a helpful exercise for those still getting used to coding in the same repository as others. You don't need to do it in pairs, you can do it yourself (and play both sides), but it's easier with another. 

The goal here is to walk you through key concepts such as making a pull request and reviewing code. This is essential to work through to be able to effectively work together to improve code and efficiency. There are a number of steps in this activity that require you to move back and forth between one person and the other driving the activity, so if it's just you by yourself, you'll need a bit of imagination. 

### Activity 3 - MSE Activity

There are two main parts to this activity. The first starts on slide 25, with an exercise that helps you work through a challenging ecological problem of your own. 

After, you'll find a link to website which you'll use to walk through the MSE activity. Please use this content to improve your understanding, especially if you intend on working through the fisheries case study. 

### Activity 4 - Writing Lay Summaries

This activity is hard to replicate asynchronously, but the goal here is to provide insight into what goes into a lay summary or a news brief, and then to give you the time and context to work through writing a lay summary for your own work. You can pick any project you're currently working on, but select one, and after reading through the beginning slides, follow the instructions to write your own summary.
