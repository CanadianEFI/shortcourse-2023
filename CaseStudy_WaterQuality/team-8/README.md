Water quality is vital for our daily activities like drinking water, swimming, and paddle boarding. High algal density severely damages the local aquatic environment by lowering oxygen concentrations, increasing fish mortality rates and raising toxin levels, which can render the water unsuitable for fundamental and recreational uses. To ensure the continued supply of these services, it is important to predict algal density several days in advance to provide enough time to managers to take appropriate measures to mitigate the deterioration of water quality and protect human populations. However, the abundance of algae in natural waters is difficult to forecast due to its complex interaction with temperature, nutrients, water levels, and hydrodynamic conditions. In our case study, we used chlorophyll a concentrations as an indicator of algal density to forecast the water quality of two Florida lakes (Lake Barco and Lake Suggs), which provide important services to nearby populations. To do so, we used historical chlorophyll a concentrations in those two lakes and daily climate records (air temperature and precipitation) between 2017 and 2022 to train a statistical model and forecast the concentration of chlorophyll a for the following 30 days. High precipitation can cause important nutrient leaching from terrestrial environments into the lake which nourish algae, whereas high temperature can further increase their growth rate by increasing their metabolism. 

Our forecasts can help policy makers make more informed decisions about water usage and treatment. Anticipating water quality days ahead through reliable temperature and precipitation forecasts will help us manage our water bodies better by proactively addressing algal blooms before they occur. Specifically, we used our forecasts to answer the following questions: 

1. Should one lake be chosen for drinking water this month over the other? (how do the 
forecasts of chlorophyll concentration differ between the sites? which is higher/lower?)

2. What are the maximum concentrations that will occur in the next 30 days? And when will this 
maximum level occur?

3. Are chlorophyll concentrations likely to be higher or lower than normal for the time of year? 
(comparison with a climatology forecast)

4. What are the chances that the lake(s) will be closed in the next month for swimming?

Although the two lakes share highly comparable climate conditions, our model shows that Lake Barco is more likely to have lower chlorophyll concentrations in the next month, which makes it more suitable for water consumption. Moreover, we found high probability that Lake Suggs will need to close in the following 30 days due to the concentrations of chlorophyll a likely reaching the threshold of 20 mg/L set by health agencies.
