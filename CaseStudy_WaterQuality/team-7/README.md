#The fast increase of microalgae in the water of aquatic environments (algae blooms) is part of a process called eutrophication. 
#This process is a challenging conservation problem in lakes and reservoirs all over the world since 
#it risks human consumption and use of water resources by decreasing their water quality. 
#Identifying future algal increases in aquatic environments can be key in order to identify eutrophication
#periods and define target policies of water use. 
#In the present project, we generated 30 days ahead predictions (July 2023) for the water quality of 
#two small tropical lakes in Florida, USA (BARC and SUGGS lakes). 
#We used chlorophyll-a data, a pigment connected with algae quantities, air temperature and humidity, 
#to understand when a bloom could occur. 
#This can inform us when lakes are in suitable swimming conditions. 
#We observed that the BARC lake presented the best water quality with lower chlorophyll-a quantities 
#in the period considered, even regarding changes in the model parameters. 
#Besides that, we observed that the model was efficient to predict chlorophyll-a changes in the BARC lake,
#but not so much in the SUGGS system. 
#Therefore, we suggest that the BARC lake be preferred for human water use and swimming activities during
#the period considered.
