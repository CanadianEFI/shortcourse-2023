# Water Quality Forecast Troubleshooting

This case study has specific software requirements that allow it to run as expected. Every machine is set up slightly differently, but this document is meant to be a first-stop-shop for if you get stuck with a software-related problem. 

## Set-up 

The water quality forecasting vignette relies on JAGS, a software for Bayesian modeling, that can be found here [https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io).
