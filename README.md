## Overview

Welcome! This repository contains all materials from the Canadian Ecological Forecasting Initiative short course on Forecasting for Decision-Making: An Epidemiological & Ecological Perspective. The course took place at the Fields Institute in Toronto, ON from July 24th - 28th 2023. The creation of this course would not have bee possible without support from the Canadian Network for Modelling Infectious Diseases, the Mathematics for Public Health at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, the University of Toronto Data Sciences Institute, the Ecological Forecasting Initiative in the United States, and Apex Resource Management Solutions. 

In the spirit of having this course be as open as possible, we have put all the course materials here on this GitHub page, including lectures, exercises and forecast modelling materials for three case studies: Infectious Disease Control, Fisheries Management, Water Quality Monitoring. For a description of the course's overall objectives, please see [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/23-24/forecasting).

### Exercises

There are a series of exercises in the `Exercises` folder for you to work through. Instructions are in the `README_EXERCISES.md` file in that directory for how to make use of those. 

There are a number of exercises that span a couple of programming approaches to the current course content. 

### Case Studies

Perhaps most importantly, we have our four case studies. A focal point of this course is having students take a case study of interest, and work on building and expanding a forecast for a focal system. In this iteration of the course there are four case studies, one on fisheries, one on water quality, and two on COVID-19. Each of the COVID-19 case studies are from different locations (Ontario and BC respectively) and take slightly different approaches. 

There are extensive documentation for each of the case studies in their respective folders, along with troubleshooting tips. Please take the time to read through each case study before starting, as each of them have slightly different software requirements. During the in-person version of this course, each case study had two teams of four students working on each one. They have tackled some of the "Decision making problems" that the instructors suggested as ways the models could be extended. You're welcome to look through their code and results as examples of how each group chose to tackle the problem.
